devnet:(https://explorer.solana.com/address/9aYFqSL95jbn72YAcdoTXjAiZfwopsV7JhkSsqKLS4cf?cluster=devnet)

This project implements an options escrow service on the Solana blockchain using the Anchor framework. The service allows users to create escrow accounts for options trading, where collateral is locked until the contract conditions are met, ensuring that both parties fulfill their obligations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Rust**: The primary language for developing smart contracts on Solana.
- **Anchor**: A framework for Solana smart contract development.
- **Solana**: The blockchain used for high-speed and low-cost transactions.
- **Solana Playground**: An interactive environment to develop and test Solana programs.

## üéØ Features
- **Option Types**: Supports Call and Put options.
- **Collateral Management**: Allows users to deposit tokens (such as SOL, USDC, or any SPL token) as collateral.
- **Fee System**: A configurable fee system where the fee rate and fee collector can be updated through governance.
- **Governance**: Supports a governance account that controls fee rates and the fee collector's address.
- **Expiration Handling**: Options are settled based on whether they expire In-The-Money (ITM) or Out-Of-The-Money (OTM).
- **Early Exercise**: Supports early exercise for American-style options.
